Hacktoberfest 2018 is underway! Join the developer community from gitconnected in working together to build a Hacker News clone for your Hacktoberfest project. Use your favorite frontend library (or follow along with our solution using React) and utilize the open source Hacker News API for your data.

Our community will be collaborating and working together to help everyone become a better developer. Join us if you're interested in learning web development.

## Collaborate

Join the #hacktoberfest channel in our [community Slack](https://community.gitconnected.com).

## What You'll Learn

- React
- Redux
- Styled Components
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex
- CSS Animations
- Using an API
- Axios for network requests
- Redux middleware
- Create React App to bootstrap a project
- localStorage for persisting state

## Getting Started

First initialize the project. Our solution uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
but feel free to use whatever you want, even static HTML.

Review the [Hacker New API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
documentation. You will need the /topstories endpoint to get the list of the
story IDs and the /item endpoint to get the data for each story individually.

Finally, get your project into production. We chose to use a Chrome Extension, but
you can host it in any manner than you wish. GitHub pages is a great option. The final solution should show a list of the top stories on Hacker News.

Join the [Slack channel](https://community.gitconnected.com) to
collaborate and get help. This project can be difficult, so make sure you work on it
with some friends!
